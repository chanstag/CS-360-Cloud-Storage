		<b>Ents</b>, called <i>Onodrim</i> (Tree-host) by the elves, are <br> a very old race that appeared in Middle-earth at the same time that the elves did. They were apparently<br> created by <u>Eru Il&uacute;vatar</u> at the behest of Yavanna after she learned<br> of Aul&euml;'s children, the Dwarves, knowing that they would want to fell trees.<br> Ents were envisioned as Shepherds of the <em>Huorns</em>, to protect the forests from orcs <br>and other perils.
